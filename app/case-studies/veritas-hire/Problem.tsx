        Hiring signals are fragmented and difficult to trust
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[17px] leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
        Modern hiring workflows rely heavily on resumes that are subjective,
        inconsistent, and often optimized for automated keyword scanners rather
        than real capability. Candidates rarely know how their experience is
        interpreted, while hiring teams struggle to extract reliable signals
        from noisy data.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[17px] leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
        As a result, feedback loops are broken. Job seekers don’t know what to
        improve, and hiring decisions are slowed by ambiguity, bias, and unclear
        criteria. This lack of transparency creates frustration on both sides of
        the process and undermines trust in hiring outcomes.

        Veritas Hire was built to address this gap by introducing structure,
        visibility, and intention into resume evaluation.
