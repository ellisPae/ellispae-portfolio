        Structured evaluation backed by transparent scoring

        Veritas Hire introduces a structured evaluation model that breaks
        resumes down into role-specific categories. Each category is assessed
        independently, allowing users to see how their experience maps to the
        expectations of a given role.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[17px] leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
        By pairing structured scoring with AI-assisted interpretation, the
        platform provides feedback that is both measurable and human-readable.
        The emphasis is on transparency: users can understand not just what
        their score is, but why it is that way and how it could improve.
