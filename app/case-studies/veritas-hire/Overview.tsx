        Veritas Hire translates unstructured resume data into structured,
        role-specific insight. Instead of producing generic summaries, the
        platform evaluates resumes across clearly defined dimensions such as
        skills alignment, experience depth, and growth potential.

      <p className="text-[17px] leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
        The goal is not to rank candidates, but to provide clarity. By making
        evaluation criteria visible and consistent, Veritas Hire helps users
        understand where they stand, what gaps exist, and how they can improve
        with intention rather than guesswork.
