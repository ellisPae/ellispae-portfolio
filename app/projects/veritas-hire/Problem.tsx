        Job seekers often struggle to interpret job descriptions or understand
        how their experience aligns with a role. Existing tools are either too
        generic, too shallow, or do not provide actionable feedback. The result
        is uncertainty, poor applications, and a lack of clarity on which roles
        are worth pursuing.
